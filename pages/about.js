                                    I am a very practical and meticulous person, eager to learn and passionate about technology.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have always received very positive feedback on agility to deliver and execute tasks on projects, and also on learning fast.
                                </p>

                                    4+ years of experience as a front-end developer. Today I have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is the basics, and have worked with some technologies like React, Next.js, Gatsby, Angular, TypeScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS preprocessors, Python, Plotly Dash, Node, Docker and Git. And I'm always studying new things, I want to be full stack, studying is part of my routine.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I used to work with design, but I wasn't 100% happy, I was looking for a new challenge in my career, so I started to study Front End and fell in love, and I think the design background helps me a lot in this area.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All I learned was by myself, studying on my own, so I consider myself a self-taught person, with easy and fast learning, because I always go after solving problems, as much as I do not understand much about that technology, I research and try hard to accomplish that challenge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I encourage women to enter the technology area and I think about participating or creating a project about it.

                                    I am open to opportunities as a freelancer, hire me on Upwork (link on contact section).
